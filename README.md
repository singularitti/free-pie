# free-pie

This is a very simple command-line memory information check tool,
by plotting a pie chart which shows how much free memory is
available.

I use framework [`node-cli-pie`](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/node-cli-pie) developed by [Ionică Bizău](https://github.com/IonicaBizau) and [`systeminformation`](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation) developed by [Sebastian Hildebrandt](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt). Thanks them :heart:!
